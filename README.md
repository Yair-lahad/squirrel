# Squirrel

Understand the flow of your money — income and spending over time, by category.

## Frontend

Single-page React app, six nav destinations (switched client-side):

- **Home** — what the app is, at a glance.
- **Charts** — spend by category (bar or pie, amount or transaction count).
  Click a category for detail: a date-vs-amount scatter, plus the Advisor's take.
- **Transactions** — the full sortable list. Click a row's category to
  reassign it.
- **Categories** — manage persistent category rules (see below) and browse
  every category in use as an icon grid.
- **Load data** — fetch real transactions from a vendor (Isracard today, via
  [`israeli-bank-scrapers`](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers))
  or load a bundled sample file.

Whichever source you load from, the other pages all read the same in-session
dataset (kept in `sessionStorage`, cleared when the tab closes).

## Backend

- **Routes** (`backend/routes/`) — HTTP only. One thin file per endpoint,
  mirroring `frontend/src/routes/`. Parses the request, calls `logic/` or
  `agents/`, shapes the response.
- **Logic** (`backend/logic/`) — the actual work, one subdir per concern:
  `analytics/` (pure number-crunching for charts/tables/KPIs), `sources/`
  (one module per transaction provider: vendor, file, mock), and
  `categorization/` (persistent category rules — see below).
- **Agents** (`backend/agents/`) — turns data into plain-English output, one
  module per agent. `advisor.js` is the first: rule-based today, meant to be
  swapped for a real AI-generated response without touching anything else.

### Category rules

Raw transaction data (vendor scrape, sample files) is never modified. Instead,
a `category_rules` table in Postgres (hosted on Supabase — see Run below)
holds a small table of rules that get layered on top of every fetch:

- **contains** — any transaction whose description contains the pattern gets
  the rule's category (auto, matches future transactions too).
- **exact** — one specific transaction description only (what clicking a row
  in the Transactions table creates).
- **category** — remaps every transaction currently in category A to
  category B (e.g. merge "Delicatessen" into "Dining").

Unlike the transaction data itself, rules persist across reloads and sessions
until deleted from the Categories page — and since they live in Supabase
rather than a local file, the same rules are shared across every machine you
run the app from.

## Run

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `DATABASE_URL` with your Supabase
connection string (Project → Connect → **Transaction pooler** — the direct
connection is IPv6-only and won't resolve on most networks).

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000. (`npm start` builds the frontend and serves it
from the Express server. `npm install` covers both backend and frontend —
they're set up as npm workspaces.)

For active development, with auto-restart/reload on every change:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs the backend (nodemon, port 3000) and the Vite dev server (port 5173,
proxying `/api/*` to the backend) side by side — use the Vite URL while
developing.
